<p>In the initial episode of this drama, Sultan Mehmed is notably seen in the company of his esteemed advisor, Aqa Mahmud Pasha.

<p>On the other hand, we witness misconceptions and crises of authority brewing within the caliphate. Sultan Mehmed harbors a dream, a vision where he places his greatest stride in the service of Beit Allah, the House of God. However, to translate this dream into reality, he must prove himself as the great emperor he aspires to be.</p>
